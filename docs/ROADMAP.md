Roadmap (Meeting-Free Phase)

MVP (current phase)
- Domains: CRUD complete (list, filter).
- Quests: CRUD, domain-scoped.
- Chapters: CRUD, quest-scoped.
- Tasks: CRUD, status enum, quest/chapter-scoped.
- Auth: Firebase Auth, Protected routes.
- Navigation: sidebar, topbar, breadcrumbs, param carry.

Near-Term
- UX polish: loading states, empty placeholders, toasts.
- Optimistic UI updates for create/edit/delete.
- Improve form validation + type safety.

Future (post-MVP)
- Meeting system re-introduction (drawer, AI summary, transcripts).
- API routes for meeting ingest and classification.
- File uploads (transcripts, docs).
- Cross-domain analytics.

Removed / Deferred
- Meeting Drawer and related API routes.
- Plaud 7-day link ingestion.
